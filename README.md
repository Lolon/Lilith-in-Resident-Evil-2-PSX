# Lilith in Resident Evil 2 PSX
This is a romhack for Resident Evil 2 for the PS1 that replaces Claire with Lilith (b0tster) from Twitter.

**IMPORTANT** This only works with Disk 2 of Resident Evil 2 Dual Shock Edition (US), also known as SLUS-00756. It WILL NOT WORK with any other version, nor the first disk. If you want it to work anywhere else, buy me a coffee :3

### HOW TO INSTALL

**1. Download all necessary files**

  For this you'll need:
  - This mod! - [Download it here!](https://github.com/Lolon/Lilith-in-Resident-Evil-2-PSX/releases/tag/Release)
  - A copy of the game! - To install this mod, you should have a .BIN and a .CUE file of Disk 2 of Resident Evil 2 Dual Shock Edition (US), also known as SLUS-00756, on your PC. I'm not going to explain how to rip your disk, there are a ton of good guides if you google it.
  - A PSX Emulator! - any will do, so take your pick! If you dont know where to start, [ePSXe](https://www.epsxe.com/) is a classic and easy to use, but lately I've been using [DuckStation](https://github.com/stenzek/duckstation). Your choice!
  - Delta Patcher - a great patching tool that this romhack uses! It comes with the mod when you download, isn't that lovely! (if you need though, you can download it [here](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/)
  
  Everything is now downloaded and ready! Yay!
  
**2. MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR GAME**

  Just in case something goes wrong, make a copy of the BIN and CUE files you made when you ripped your disk. Wouldn't want to go through all that faff of ripping your disk again, do you?
  
**3. Run Delta Patcher**

  Double click DeltaPatcherLite.exe to open up Delta Patcher!

**4. put your game in the Original File box**

  Put your SLUS-00756 BIN file into the Original File box. Double check that it is the BIN file, not the CUE file!
 
**5. Put the patch into the XDelta Patch box**

   `[SLUS_00756]Lilithfied_Claire.xdelta` goes into the patch box!    
   It should end up looking a little like this:

**6. Hit Apply Patch**

   Press the 'Apply Patch' button to apply the romhack to your game! This should take just a moment.
   
**7. Test your game**

   Boot up your game in your emulator of choice, and when starting a new game, Lilith should appear instead of Claire!!!!

### ACKKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND THANK YOUS

In the future I want to break down how I made this, but I don't have enough time to do so right now, so here are people I simply have to thank!

- Leo2236 for RE2MV, a very convienient tool for replacing RE models and textures!
- Wes67 for RE2 Rebuilder - The tool that I eventually found for inserting the model back into the game and for it to run!
